This Project is solely intended for Learning purposes , there are other efficient ways out there to implement these Deep Neural Networks . I wanted to do a under the hood view of what goes on behind the scenes of Neural Networks

Objective
The objective is to create a 4 Layer Neural Network for the MNIST dataset ( The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 255.)

Input
The Input matrix (X) to this network will be a 784 x m matrix where each of Column represents an example digit / training sample that contains 784 greyscale pixel values in the form of rows .
